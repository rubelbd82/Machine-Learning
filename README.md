# Machine Learning

While I was following an online tutorial on Udemy, I implemented all the machine learning algorithms by using python. Some algorithms are implemented in R. 
Machine learning algorithms included in this repository are: 
1. XGBoost
2. Convolutional Neural Network
3. Recursive Neural Network
4. Support Vector Machine
5. K-nearest neighbors
6. Naive Bayes
7. Natural Language Processing
